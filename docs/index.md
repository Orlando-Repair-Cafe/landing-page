# Welcome to Orlando Repair Cafe

Welcome to the Orlando Repair Cafe documentation site! We are a community-driven initiative dedicated to reducing waste and promoting sustainability through repair education and workshops.

## What is a Repair Cafe?

A Repair Cafe is a free community event where people bring broken items and learn how to fix them with the help of volunteers. Our mission is to:

- **Reduce waste** by extending the life of everyday items
- **Build community** by bringing neighbors together
- **Share knowledge** through hands-on repair education
- **Promote sustainability** by encouraging a culture of repair over replacement

## What We Repair

- Electronics (computers, phones, tablets)
- Small appliances (toasters, lamps, fans)
- Clothing and textiles
- Furniture and woodwork
- Bicycles
- And more!
